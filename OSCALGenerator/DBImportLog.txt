                        Account Category
                     
                        
                        Description
                     
                        Non-privileged
                     
For application access ONLY (I.E. Cherwell). Does not provide the ability to access any servers that are bound to AD.
                     
Privileged
                     
For accessing ALL ‘member servers’ (non-Domain Controllers) within the boundary (I.E. Jump Hosts). These accounts are used for daily administration of servers within the boundary. These accounts are restricted from logging onto Domain Controllers.
                     
Domain Admin (DA)
                     
For logging onto Domain Controllers and performing domain level administration. These accounts are restricted from logging onto ‘member servers’, and are only used for domain administration purposes. Very few people have these accounts.
                     The System Manager defines the following types of information system accounts, as follows:
Account Type
                     
Description
                     
Individual
                     
Each account has a unique username and password associated to the individual user who will be using the account.
All three account categories listed above are individual accounts in the MS Active Directory infrastructure.
                     
Group
                     
According to the VITG-OC-POL-1, VITG Cloud Security Policy, Section 4.1, no group access accounts are allowed within the VITG Cloud. Every individual must have a unique account that provides unique identity.
                     
Service Account
                     
The Service Account has two purposes:
Applications authenticate to other applications; for example, the Vulnerability Scanner communicates to Cloud server for authenticated scanning.
For application service management (I.E SQL, Traverse, Ivanti etc.…) to start/stop MS services for applications that require service accounts. Generally they have elevated privileges, thus passwords are controlled within Password Manager Pro.
                     
Guest Anonymous
                     
According to the VITG-OC-POL-1, VITG Cloud Security Policy, Section 4.1, no guest or anonymous accounts are allowed within the within the VITG Cloud.
                     
Temporary
                     
                        
A Temporary Account is allowed for short-term surge support, conforming to the rules established in KA 10621, How To: On-Board Temporary Support Personnel (9/19/2016) that resides in Cherwell. The System Manager requires that a Temporary Account has the same security requirements as a normal individual account by requiring the following:
                        
Establish need and access statement
                        
Identify charging/billing model
                        
The Temporary Account holder must:
                        
Sign Data Center rules of behavior
                        
Take and complete security awareness training
                        
The ISSO submits a Cherwell ticket to create an account based on need/access statement.
                        
For access to each customer environment:
                        
Data center management determines impact/access to existing customers.
                        
ISSO contacts customer/program ISSO to submit new support personnel.
                        
New support personnel takes and completes customer security awareness training.
                     
                        
Administrator
                     
                        
System Administrators and Managers use the “Administrator” account that has FULL access to Domain Controllers, all member servers, and devices that are bound to the Active Directory. This emergency account password is kept in the Password Manager Pro application to support disaster/recovery scenarios.
                     Customer ResponsibilityCustomers are responsible for identifying and selecting the types of information system accounts to support organizational missions/business functions in the Customer environment.The VITG Cloud System Manager has defined and assigned account managers for the VITG Cloud system account management as follows:SOC Manager: Managing accounts for SOC team membersNOC Manager: Managing accounts for NOC team membersEngineering Manager: Managing accounts for InfrastructureThe process is associated with the staffing activity and associated role assignment where the System Manager creates a ticket in Cherwell to create a task for the AD administrator to assign the account managers the ability to manage the accounts in their respective areas of responsibility.According to the VITG-OC-POL-1, VITG Cloud Security Policy, Section 4.1, no Group accounts are allowed; that is, there is no instance of a single group account with a shared password.During the on-boarding process, Account Managers determine the role(s) for each team member to link their individual account to a proper AD permission group and then to create a ticket in Cherwell to have an individual assigned a role(s) that contains the access privileges associated in Attachment 10: Roles and Privileges Matrix.The ISSO and System Manager specifies authorized users of the VITG Cloud, along with role membership and access privileges and other attributes (as required) for each account based on the business needs.Access privileges are defined in Attachment 10: Roles and Privileges Matrix.A System Administrator assigns access privileges through MS Active Directory, which is used to identify authorized users of the information system and specify access privileges.Prior to a user account being created in the AD, an Account Manager submits an account request KA 10558, How To: VITG Cloud Account Creationin Cherwell. This process is defined in the VITG Cloud Access Management Process and Procedures Guide.Once the System Manager and ISSO have approved the account, the system administrator establishes and activates the account and distributes the credentials.The VITG-OC-POL-1, VITG Cloud Security Policy, Section 4.1 requires Account Managers to approve requests for information system accounts and ensure the following items are completed:Completed VITG Cloud Access Request KA 10558, How To: VITG Cloud Account CreationSigned VITG Cloud Rules of Behavior (ROB) KA10590, Reference: VITG Cloud Rules of Behavior DocumentEmail containing certification and approval from Security Operations Manager or ISSOThe account request ticket is then forwarded to the AD system administrator, who creates the user account in the VITG Cloud AD system.Once the VITG Cloud System Manager approves all system individual accounts to be created or changed through the Cherwell ticket, then the System Administrator creates, enables, modifies, disables, and removes VITG Cloud system accounts in accordance with system account policies and procedures defined in the VITG Cloud Access Management Process and Procedures Guide, 0.8. This includes all account types and categories, as listed in Part a:Non-privilegedPrivilegedDomain Admin (DA)All system account activities are authorized through the Cherwell ticketing system.Account Creation, Enablement, and ModificationSystem account modification requires approval from the VITG Cloud ISSO prior to performing account modification. The exception to this is downgrading an account from privileged to non-privileged access; that is, based on a role change the account system administrator can downgrade a user’s access prior to notifying the ISSO of such a change.Account Disablement and RemovalSystem account disablement can be accomplished prior to notifying the VITG Cloud ISSO. However, the ISSO is notified as soon as possible when an account is disabled, along with the reason for disabling the account. Account removal requires VITG Cloud ISSO approval.Account disablement is tracked as a ticket in Cherwell and pertains to the following systems:CherwellTraverseActive DirectoryAlienVaultRSANessusSecurity CentervCenterTACACSPassword Manager ProCisco Security Operations ManagerCustomer ResponsibilityThe Customer system administrator is responsible for creating, enabling, modifying, disabling, and removing users’ accounts within the Customer environment.Security Analysts monitor the use of all VITG Cloud system accounts (with no exception) through alerts generated by Alien Vault. System Administrators configure the VITG Cloud MMS SIEM to send alerts for system configuration changes and user account creations, enablement, deletions, modifications, and removal.The alerts appear on the Alien Vault user interface as well as generating an ‘event’ in the Cherwell ticketing system. The Security Analysts monitor the event queue 24x7 for any new events. They can either be dismissed as false positive/authorized/allowed or provoke the analyst to generate an incident ticket. The incident ticket process is consistent with processes described in the IR family of controls, specifically IR-4 Incident Handling within this document. Both the alert in AlienVault and the event in Cherwell are independently analyzed. System and account monitoring is also described in SI-4.As defined in the VITG Cloud Employee On-Boarding and Off-Boarding , VITG Human Resources department (HR) notifies account managers when:Accounts are no longer requiredUsers are terminated or transferredAccount Managers have responsibility for understanding changes to system usage or need-to-know for the users for which they are responsible.The notification is performed in the VITG email system and sent to a distribution list.Customer ResponsibilityThe Customer is responsible for notifying Cloud personnel when Customer accounts are no longer required, when users are terminated or transferred, and when individual information system usage or need-to-know changes.The VITG Cloud System Manager and ISSO authorize access to the information system based on:A valid access authorizationIntended system usage based on missions/business functionsAll personnel requiring access to the information system are granted access only after there is a documented access request submitted to the VITG Cloud ticketing system and approved by the System Manager and VITG Cloud ISSO. The access request includes the intended use, purpose, and reason for system use for granting access to the information system.The VITG Cloud Employee On-Boarding and Off-Boarding establishes a formal access process to justify, authorize, and document the need for access to the information system:Confirmation of new hire.Submit request for accounts to General Dynamics IT (VITG).Notify Operations and Engineering Managers about the new hire.Notify Facility Security Officer (FSO) about the new hire:BadgingFacility access (the access level is determined by the manager)New hire orientation.If applicable: For non-VITG employees a signed VITG Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is required.Submit request for VITG Cloud accounts (varies per role).VITG Cloud accounts created.The VITG Cloud ISSO reviews all system accounts and individual assigned role(s) that contains the access privileges (specified in Attachment 10: Roles and Privileges Matrix) for compliance with account management requirements annually as part of the continuous monitoring process and to ensure all system accounts associated with terminated, transferred or downgraded personnel have been properly removed or maintained.In response to the ticket, the system administrator generates a report of the accounts assigned to each group (role). The ISSO and management team evaluate the report to review that each assigned account is assigned the appropriate role(s). Tasks are generated from the Cherwell ticket to make any required updates. The NOC or Directory Services will then make those updates, depending on the authorization required for each group.The VITG Cloud Security Calendar, maintained on the secure VITG Cloud SharePoint site, initiates the annual System Accounts Review. The results of the review are recorded in the Cherwell ticket. In response to the ticket, the system administrator generates a report of the accounts assigned to each group (role). The ISSO and management team evaluate the report to review that each assigned account is assigned the appropriate role(s). Tasks are generated from the Cherwell ticket to make any required updates. The NOC or Directory Services will then make those updates, depending on the authorization required for each group.Customer ResponsibilityThe Customer is responsible for reviewing all system accounts for compliance with account management requirements annually as part of their continuous monitoring process and to ensure accounts associated with terminated, transferred or downgraded personnel are properly removed or maintained.This part is NA. According to VITG-OC-POL-1, VITG Cloud Security Policy, Section 4.1, no Group or Shared accounts are allowed within the VITG Cloud environment, i.e., no instance of a single group account with a shared password.Customer ResponsibilityCustomers are responsible for reissuing shared/group account credentials (if deployed) when individuals are removed from the group.   ##

Name:description Type:System.String Tag:<control-implementation><implemented-requirement  control-id="ac-2"><statement  statement-id="ac-2_stmt.a"><description> Detail:The VITG Cloud System Manager identifies and selects three system account categories and six account types to support organizational missions/business functions.The three account categories are as follows:
                        Account Category
                     
                        
                        Description
                     
                        Non-privileged
                     
For application access ONLY (I.E. Cherwell). Does not provide the ability to access any servers that are bound to AD.
                     
Privileged
                     
For accessing ALL ‘member servers’ (non-Domain Controllers) within the boundary (I.E. Jump Hosts). These accounts are used for daily administration of servers within the boundary. These accounts are restricted from logging onto Domain Controllers.
                     
Domain Admin (DA)
                     
For logging onto Domain Controllers and performing domain level administration. These accounts are restricted from logging onto ‘member servers’, and are only used for domain administration purposes. Very few people have these accounts.
                     The System Manager defines the following types of information system accounts, as follows:
Account Type
                     
Description
                     
Individual
                     
Each account has a unique username and password associated to the individual user who will be using the account.
All three account categories listed above are individual accounts in the MS Active Directory infrastructure.
                     
Group
                     
According to the VITG-OC-POL-1, VITG Cloud Security Policy, Section 4.1, no group access accounts are allowed within the VITG Cloud. Every individual must have a unique account that provides unique identity.
                     
Service Account
                     
The Service Account has two purposes:
Applications authenticate to other applications; for example, the Vulnerability Scanner communicates to Cloud server for authenticated scanning.
For application service management (I.E SQL, Traverse, Ivanti etc.…) to start/stop MS services for applications that require service accounts. Generally they have elevated privileges, thus passwords are controlled within Password Manager Pro.
                     
Guest Anonymous
                     
According to the VITG-OC-POL-1, VITG Cloud Security Policy, Section 4.1, no guest or anonymous accounts are allowed within the within the VITG Cloud.
                     
Temporary
                     
                        
A Temporary Account is allowed for short-term surge support, conforming to the rules established in KA 10621, How To: On-Board Temporary Support Personnel (9/19/2016) that resides in Cherwell. The System Manager requires that a Temporary Account has the same security requirements as a normal individual account by requiring the following:
                        
Establish need and access statement
                        
Identify charging/billing model
                        
The Temporary Account holder must:
                        
Sign Data Center rules of behavior
                        
Take and complete security awareness training
                        
The ISSO submits a Cherwell ticket to create an account based on need/access statement.
                        
For access to each customer environment:

New support personnel takes and completes customer security awareness training.
                     
                        
Administrator

Both the policy and procedures documents are managed by the change management process. Therefore, the review process is as follows:Knowledge Manager receives an automated notification when the Knowledge Article (KA), with associated policy is 30 days out from annual review.Knowledge Manager assigns the review to the ISSO and places the KA in the review queue in the tool.During the review, if the ISSO needs to make an update to the KA, the document change process is followed:The knowledge manager unlocks the baseline version of the document from the CMDB and sends to the ISSOThe ISSO updates the document and submits a change request, which goes through CAB approval.After CAB approval the document is sent to the knowledge managerThe Knowledge Manager locks the new baseline word document and attaches it to the CI record in the CMDBThe Knowledge Manger creates a PDF from the word document and attaches it to the associate Knowledge Article.The Knowledge Manager changes the KA’s review date to the following year.

An example would be an attacker stopping the process of antivirus software.System eventsThese can provide insight on what an attacker did and when. If an attacker attempted to install something, it may show up on system events.For Web applications:All administrator activityAttackers always attempt to escalate their privileges when compromising a system. Tracking administrator activity can help in an investigation to determine what was done and when.Authentication checksThese can be correlated with other logs to determine how an attacker breached or attempted to breach the system.Authorization checksThese can be correlated with other logs to determine how an attacker breached or attempted to breach the system.Data deletionsAn attacker may attempt to cover his/her tracks by deleting data.

The 3PAO is responsible for developing the Security Assessment Plan (SAP) that describes the scope of the assessment including:Security controls and control enhancements under assessmentAssessment procedures to be used to determine security control effectivenessAssessment environment, assessment team, and assessment roles and responsibilitiesThe 3PAO creates a plan using the FedRAMP SAP template. The SAP identifies all the assets within the scope of the assessment, including components such as hardware, software, and physical facilities. It also provides a roadmap and methodology for execution of the tests and indicates that they will use the FedRAMP associated security test cases that are provided in the form of a worksheet.Once completed, the 3PAO submits the SAP to the FedRAMP PMO for approval in the timeline dictated by the PMO for reaccreditation.VITG contracts an approved 3PAO to conduct the assessment on a schedule dictated by the FedRAMP PMO office, currently on an annual basis determined by the anniversary of the initial P-ATO. The 3PAO assesses the security controls dictated in the Security Assessment Plan (SAP) and previously approved by the FedRAMP PMO, as they are implemented in the in the VITG Cloud. The assessment determines the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and produce the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system.The 3PAO assesses the security controls in the VITG Cloud for the initial authorization and (then annually thereafter) to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system.The 3PAO performs the testing of the VITG Cloud by following the procedures detailed in the SAP and in accordance with the test case procedures.As part of the continuous monitoring program and to satisfy annual testing requirements, the 3PAO will review the VITG Cloud documented controls to assess all applicable controls for a moderate system during a three-year cycle based on a 1/3rd scheme; that is, during each annual assessment a review of 1/3rd of the controls shall take place.The 3PAO produces a security assessment report (SAR) that documents the results of the assessment using the FedRAMP PMO provided template.The purpose of this document is to provide the system owner and the cloud service provider (CSP) a security assessment on a cloud system that evaluates the system's implementation of, and compliance with, the FedRAMP baseline security controls. The implementation of security controls is described in the System Security Plan, and required by FedRAMP to meet Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) compliance mandatesThe 3PAO provides the results of the security assessment to VITG, the FedRAMP PMO, and the FedRAMP Joint Advisory Board (JAB) using the FedRAMP PMO provided Security Assessment Report (SAR) template. This report includes recommendation of Authorization to Operate . The 3PAO produces both a written report as well as an oral slide presentation, delivered to the panels dictated by the FedRAMP PMO.The VITG Cloud SAP/SAR and the VITG Cloud authorization statement are then assembled into a complete VITG Cloud A&A package, which is provided to the VITG Cloud ISSO and VITG ISSO for review and submission to the FedRAMP JAB.   ##

Each entry tracks a unique finding, and includes its name, a description, the source used to detect the vulnerability, the assets involved, a remediation plan, the date detected, planned milestones and remediation dates, and the status of and requests for deviation from standard policy. At a minimum, items dependent on vendor interaction must be updated on a monthly basis. Resolved items are removed from the open items tracker while newly discovered items create new line items in the tracker.The POA&M tracker contains the following headings (as required by FedRAMP):

​Vendor Dependency (P)
                     
                        
This column should specify whether the remediation of theweakness requires the action of a third party vendor. Should a weakness bevendordependent, a monthly update with the third party vendor is required.In these cases, the weakness cannot be remediated, and the POA&Mitemcannot be closed, but the completion date may be extended if amonthly update is made. If the completion date is extended, provide an updatein Column N, Milestone Changes. Once a patch is available, the CSPhas30 days to remediate high vulnerabilities and 90 days toremediate moderate vulnerabilities according to FedRAMP standards.Thistimeframe begins on the date that the patch is released. The CSPmust include the patch release date in column Z (comments). In this case,the CSP may overwrite the auto-calculated scheduled completion datefoundin columnL.​

State the status of the weakness deviation request for false positive.A false positive means the weakness is determined to be non-existentand is a false positive provided by the vulnerability scanner. ACSP determination of a false positive will cause this column to be setto “pending”, the deviation is finalized (setting the status to “yes”) if itis​ approved by the AO. Approved false positives can also be closed,see section 2.2 for guidance on closing a POA&Mitem.

                     The VITG Cloud ISSO reviews and updates the VITG Cloud POA&M at least monthly to ensure that it is in compliance with the FedRAMP standards and delivered to the FedRAMP PMO via MAX.gov.As a weakness or deficiency is identified, the ISSO creates a unique ticket in the ticket system for tracking through its lifecycle and documents the ticket in the POA&M tracker. During monthly updates, the ISSO validates each POA&M line item against raw assessment scan data, maintenance activity, and configuration changes documented within those POA&M tickets. The ISSO updates all fields of the template as prescribed in the FedRAMP POA&M Template guidance.   ##

Name:description Type:System.String Tag:<control-implementation><implemented-requirement  control-id="ca-5"><statement  statement-id="ca-5_stmt.a"><description> Detail:On a monthly schedule dictated by the FedRAMP PMO, the ISSO maintains the POA&M tracker by updating tracking information related to all vulnerability and audit findings. Each entry tracks a unique finding, and includes its name, a description, the source used to detect the vulnerability, the assets involved, a remediation plan, the date detected, planned milestones and remediation dates, and the status of and requests for deviation from standard policy. At a minimum, items dependent on vendor interaction must be updated on a monthly basis. Resolved items are removed from the open items tracker while newly discovered items create new line items in the tracker.The POA&M tracker contains the following headings (as required by FedRAMP):

                     The VITG Cloud information system is assessed by the 3PAO on an annual basis. The 3PAO produces a Security Assessment Plan, which must be approved by the JAB prior to testing. Following the testing, the 3PAO produces a Security Assessment Report (SAR). This testing is conducted at least annually or when there is a significant change to the system.The ISSO performs ongoing security status monitoring of the metrics defined in section a of this control. Cherwell tickets are generated to maintain tracked visitor logs, security incidents, new assets, security incidents and resolution, vulnerabilities, and POA&Ms. Training completion records are stored in SharePoint.The ISSO with the security team performs correlation and analysis of security-related information generated by assessments and monitoring to produce a remediation strategy that becomes a CR if a change is needed to the system.The ISSO also takes the information provided by the 3PAO in the SAR and generates POA&M items for remediation, tracking, and reporting purposes. Other findings from continuous monitoring activities are either remediated immediately if possible or added to the POA&M list. The POA&M list allows the ISSO to see all relevant system vulnerabilities and risks in one place, making it easier to correlate and analyze the security-related information.The VITG ISSO works with the System Owner to prioritize resources dedicated to response actions following analysis of security findings. With visibility of the overall status of the IS, the ISSO categorizes risks and the remediation efforts in order to achieve the greatest reduction of overall risk as quickly as possible. If a finding cannot be remediated immediately, the ISSO works with the System Owner to assess impact, coordinate resources, and devise a plan for remediation. The item is added to the POA&M list to be reported to the FedRAMP PMO monthly and tracked and remediated in accordance with the risk levels and timelines established in RA-5.The ISSO reports the security status to FedRAMP of the VITG Cloud in the monthly POA&M and inventory update. This monthly reporting activity provides detailed tracking and monitoring of vulnerabilities along with raw scan reports. The 3PAO provides the Security Assessment Report (SAR) to FedRAMP on an annual basis.   ##

Once the settings are confirmed in place, a Tripwire scan is run against the server to verify that it passes the required configuration checks and discrepancies are remediated.; For Linux servers and all network or storage devices:; The STIG requirements are manually implemented against the device. Once the settings are confirmed in place, a Tripwire scan is run against the server to verify that it passes the required configuration checks and discrepancies are remediated.; The following roles establishes and documents configuration settings for information technology products employed within the VITG Cloud:If there is a new technology deployed to the environment, the ISSO validates if there is a valid STIG for that technology. If so, VITG Cloud implements that STIG. If not, the ISSO selects other configuration guidance from another organization (e.g., CIS) or from the vendor.The Technology owner identifies required deviations and communicates them to the ISSO, who is responsible for approving or denying.The ISSO periodically views the latest STIGs and determines if a new one needs to be analyzed and applied to the respective technology.As an enhancement to USGCB standards and as required by the customers of the VITG Cloud, the configuration settings of DISA STIGs establish system configuration standards, when applicable.The system components are measured and validated against Tripwire policies during a periodic scan (as defined in CM-6(1)) of the system. The policies that Tripwire uses are based on settings provided by the respective STIG settings. As STIGs are updated by DoD, Tripwire updates the policies to reflect the new settings if applicable.The Security Engineer downloads and applies the rulesets and applicable tests to meet STIG configurations from the Tripwire User Portal as they are published by the vendor. Vendor publication does not occur more than quarterly.Table 11-6 below outlines the STIGs that have been selected for each technology.

                     Table 11-6. Configuration StandardsThe appropriate technology engineer implements the configuration settings, as follows:For Windows servers:For most STIG configuration settings in the Windows environment, the Windows Engineer applies settings to servers in the domain through the use of Domain Group Policy Objects (GPO). Configurations unable to be applied through the domain policy are configured manually on individual systems. The Security Engineer executes Tripwire scans following maintenance and at least weekly to validate that it meets the STIG requirements.For Linux servers and all network or storage devices:The Linux Engineer applies some standard configuration through the Centrify Configuration Manager module of the Active Directory. The Linux Engineer manually implements the STIG configurations unable to be applied through Centrify. The Security Engineer executes Tripwire scans following maintenance and at least weekly to validate that it meets the STIG requirements.For Infrastructure devices:The Network Engineer applies all network configurations directly to infrastructure systems. The Security Engineer executes Tripwire scans following maintenance and at least weekly to validate that it meets the STIG requirements.The process for identifying, documenting, and approving any deviations from established configuration settings is governed by the compliance exception process as described in KA 10794, Compliance Exception Procedure.The steps involved in the above KA are as follows:Identify: The Technology Owner identifies required deviations and communicates them to the ISSO who is responsible for approving or denying.Approve: The ISSO who is responsible for approving or denying.Document: The Security Engineers implement waivers in Tripwire and annotate the approval provided by the ISSO.Justify: The requester provides a justification for the non-compliance of the specific setting. Reasons for exceptions are consistent with FedRAMP deviation requests regarding vulnerabilities as follows: 1) Operational Requirement: the setting cannot be configured without negatively impacting the operation of the system; 2) False Positive: the setting has been applied but is still appearing as a finding in the Tripwire report or the setting is not applicable to the system component (cannot be applied).This process dictates the approval procedure and artifacts necessary to document an exception to the STIG configuration as well as recurring review requirements and includes the following procedures.The change of configuration is governed by the VITG Cloud Change Management Process and Procedures Guide, which includes the deviation request and approval from the FedRAMP PMO. The VITG Cloud Engineering Team reviews changes and updates the baseline configuration stored in the Cherwell ticketing system where required for operational or service delivery reasons.The VITG Cloud personnel monitor and control changes to the configuration settings in accordance with organizational policies and procedures, as follows:Monitoring of configuration settings is conducted as follows: Tripwire automatically runs configuration scans of all components in the VITG Cloud IaaS. The scans compare the settings applied to each component with the policy established in Tripwire (see Table 11-6). If the component setting is consistent with the policy the report shows the component setting as “green” compliant. If the component setting is not consistent with the policy—deviations notwithstanding. See CM-6 part c—the Tripwire report shows the setting as “red” non-compliant. The scans are automatically run daily and reports are automatically sent by the Tripwire system to the ISSO and the specific technology owners. This allows configuration settings to be monitored.VITG Cloud Configuration-Change Manager controls changes to the configuration settings in accordance with the VITG Cloud Change Management Process and Procedures Guide.Controlling Changes to Configuration SettingsThe authorized change process is documented in CM-3 .   ##

If so, VITG Cloud implements that STIG. If not, the ISSO selects other configuration guidance from another organization (e.g., CIS) or from the vendor.The Technology owner identifies required deviations and communicates them to the ISSO, who is responsible for approving or denying.The ISSO periodically views the latest STIGs and determines if a new one needs to be analyzed and applied to the respective technology.As an enhancement to USGCB standards and as required by the customers of the VITG Cloud, the configuration settings of DISA STIGs establish system configuration standards, when applicable.The system components are measured and validated against Tripwire policies during a periodic scan (as defined in CM-6(1)) of the system. The policies that Tripwire uses are based on settings provided by the respective STIG settings. As STIGs are updated by DoD, Tripwire updates the policies to reflect the new settings if applicable.The Security Engineer downloads and applies the rulesets and applicable tests to meet STIG configurations from the Tripwire User Portal as they are published by the vendor. Vendor publication does not occur more than quarterly.Table 11-6 below outlines the STIGs that have been selected for each technology.

Name:description Type:System.String Tag:<control-implementation><implemented-requirement  control-id="cm-6"><statement  statement-id="cm-6_stmt.a"><description> Detail:The following roles establishes and documents configuration settings for information technology products employed within the VITG Cloud:If there is a new technology deployed to the environment, the ISSO validates if there is a valid STIG for that technology. If so, VITG Cloud implements that STIG. If not, the ISSO selects other configuration guidance from another organization (e.g., CIS) or from the vendor.The Technology owner identifies required deviations and communicates them to the ISSO, who is responsible for approving or denying.The ISSO periodically views the latest STIGs and determines if a new one needs to be analyzed and applied to the respective technology.As an enhancement to USGCB standards and as required by the customers of the VITG Cloud, the configuration settings of DISA STIGs establish system configuration standards, when applicable.The system components are measured and validated against Tripwire policies during a periodic scan (as defined in CM-6(1)) of the system. The policies that Tripwire uses are based on settings provided by the respective STIG settings. As STIGs are updated by DoD, Tripwire updates the policies to reflect the new settings if applicable.The Security Engineer downloads and applies the rulesets and applicable tests to meet STIG configurations from the Tripwire User Portal as they are published by the vendor. Vendor publication does not occur more than quarterly.Table 11-6 below outlines the STIGs that have been selected for each technology.

The scans compare the settings applied to each component with the policy established in Tripwire (see Table 11-6). If the component setting is consistent with the policy the report shows the component setting as “green” compliant. If the component setting is not consistent with the policy—deviations notwithstanding. See CM-6 part c—the Tripwire report shows the setting as “red” non-compliant.

The scans compare the settings applied to each component with the policy established in Tripwire (see Table 11-6). If the component setting is consistent with the policy the report shows the component setting as “green” compliant. If the component setting is not consistent with the policy—deviations notwithstanding. See CM-6 part c—the Tripwire report shows the setting as “red” non-compliant. The scans are automatically run daily and reports are automatically sent by the Tripwire system to the ISSO and the specific technology owners.

Whenever there is a change to the inventory, the CMDB is updated. The CMDB contains all of the Configuration Items (CIs) associated with the VITG Cloud system boundary.Section 9.1 of this document lists the current Hardware InventorySection 9.2 of this document lists the current Software InventorySection 9.3 of this document lists the current Network InventoryThe organization develops, documents, and maintains an inventory of information system components that is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking, reporting, and accountability as defined in the VITG Cloud Service Asset and Configuration Management Process and Procedures Guide. CI attributes in the CMDB deemed necessary to achieve accountability are as follows:

Administrators are permitted to install software related to their role only in accordance with Change Management procedures and the SDLC.The information system employs certificate signed software whitelisting through Ivanti Application Control to deny-by-default, approve-by-exception, the execution of installed components on Windows operating systems. As the application operates at the kernel level, software not approved to execute in the information system is halted before entering memory.Cisco, ESXi, NetApp, and other appliances have no mechanism for user applied software.RHEL servers do not fall under the protection of Ivanti, however, they are monitored by Security Analysts using the SIEM solution, which provides alerting in the event that software is installed on the server(s). Access to RHEL servers is restricted to administrators only.Ivanti provides monitoring of policy compliance by restricting the installation of software not contained on the approved whitelist. Ivanti Application Control will cause the installation to fail until it has been approved through a Service Request and the NOC updates the whitelist.Logs of software installations on both Windows and RHEL servers are recorded within the SIEM AlienVault.   ##

When all errors are corrected, they each approve the document by signature and date. The signatures are added to the Plan Approvals page of the VITG Cloud Contingency Plan.The System Manager maintains the Contingency Plan on the secure VITG Cloud SharePoint site where it is managed as part of the documentation baseline for the VITG Cloud IaaS.The Contingency Plan is distributed to key personnel in two ways:Link to the VITG Cloud SharePoint site distributed through emails to people on the Key Personnel listHard copies made available through request and delivered via company internal mail to individualsChanges to the documentation are managed through the change management process. As changes occur to the CP, emails are sent to the key personnel to announce the change and to provide a link for online access to the Plan.The VITG Cloud Contingency Plan identifies key personnel (Appendix A) to which copies (and updates) of the plan are distributed, including FedRAMP personnel.The CP is provided as part of the security authorization package and is made available to the JAB, FedRAMP ISSO, and VITG Cloud teams.

In addition IR reporting is part of the annual contingency plan testing.Meetings are scheduled every six months as a forum for CP personnel and IR personnel to discuss scenarios where an incident could lead to a CP event. For example, during the course of a response to an incident, the security team may state that the Cloud needs to swap operations to the other site, thus invoking the Contingency Plan. An example of this might be if malware has infected all the Westminster machines, Cloud would swap control to Manassas using the Contingency Plan and pull all the machines in Westminster offline to resolve.These periodic meetings also allow the two teams to coordinate exercises and testing to make sure that these activities do not cause a disruption. The teams also plan IR exercises that escalate into a CP condition.Finally, CP and IR exercise and test events are preceded by notifications to all affected parties, so that no one will think the exercise is a real situation.The System Manager and ISSO review the VITG Cloud Contingency Plan annually or as changes in the system occur and updated as necessary:The annual reviews are initiated by the VITG Cloud Security Calendar as well as embedded into Cherwell as a documentation review task. On an annual basis, the Knowledge Manager assigns a reviewer and places the KA in their review queue in the tool. The reviewer reads through the document and identifies any errors or inconsistencies with current practice or team membership. The reviewer makes updates to resolve the wording and updates the Document Revision History.All change to the policy and procedures is then reviewed by the Knowledge Manager. The results of the review are recorded both in the policy and/or procedures change page and in the Cherwell ticket.The VITG Cloud CP is updated as needed to address changes to the organization, information system, or environment of operation; and problems encountered during contingency plan implementation, execution, or testingCP-2(a)6 is the initial review and approval of the plan by someone with authority and CP-2(d) is the periodic review of the plan. CP-2(e) gets the update done for any reason. The ISSO submits a ticket, then the document is updated by the ISSO and System Manager or other roles involved in the specific update and then is approved.Updates are required in order to ensure changes are reflected in the document, to include the following:Organization changes: additions or removals of personnel or rolesEnvironment of operation changes: removal or additional of components or capabilitiesProblems encountered during contingency plan implementation, execution, or testing: CP-4 requires that the contingency plan be tested periodically. Any lessons learned from the testing are integrated into document updates. Additionally, lessons learned or discovered discrepancies resulting from contingency plan implementation or execution are captured in future iterations of the document to ensure they are properly addressed.The VITG Cloud Contingency Coordinator distributes the Contingency Plan to the team (in Appendix A) when changes are made. The updated document is uploaded to the internal VITG SharePoint site and a link is sent out to the team members as stated above.The System Manager protects the Contingency Plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification by maintaining it in the Cherwell repository. All changes are governed by the change management process. Cherwell is an access controlled ticketing system which allows for document maintenance. Access is granten in accordance with procedures established for AC-2.   ##

                     The Contingency Plan Director develops test plans in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-34 (as amended) and provides plans to FedRAMP prior to initiating testing. Test plans are approved and accepted by the Authorizing Official prior to initiating testing.After testing is completed, an AAR is conducted and the results, based on the testing and other feedback, influence the updates made to the contingency plan (this is also part (c) of this control). Testing helps to determine:The effectiveness of the plan: As the team follows the plan during testing, issues arise in executing specific plan steps, identifying areas of the plan needing improvement.Organizational readiness: Areas identified as a failure provide insight into opportunities for improvement. Failures in key areas of a test can indicate a “non-ready” state.After each test, the Contingency Planning Director reviews the contingency plan test After Action Report (AAR), as an in the example below. The Contingency Plan Director then signs the report.The Contingency Planning Director initiates corrective actions for areas that need adjustments and/or improvements. Adjustments can affect both the CP document and the test plans. To initiate corrective actions, the Contingency Plan Director opens Cherwell ticket(s) as appropriate to correct any deficiencies. Issues that cannot be resolved immediately are assigned to the ISSO to include in the POA&M process.   ##

                     The Contingency Plan Director develops test plans in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-34 (as amended) and provides plans to FedRAMP prior to initiating testing. Test plans are approved and accepted by the Authorizing Official prior to initiating testing.After testing is completed, an AAR is conducted and the results, based on the testing and other feedback, influence the updates made to the contingency plan (this is also part (c) of this control). Testing helps to determine:The effectiveness of the plan: As the team follows the plan during testing, issues arise in executing specific plan steps, identifying areas of the plan needing improvement.Organizational readiness: Areas identified as a failure provide insight into opportunities for improvement. Failures in key areas of a test can indicate a “non-ready” state. Desc:implemented-requirement control-id, description  ##

For non-AD integrated devices, the identifier is assigned by adding the username directly to the device.If there is a case where there is potential for two users to have the same identifier (e.g., Randy Smith and Robert Smith), additional uniqueness is added to the username that is the most recent. For example, if Randy Smith (rsmith) were already a user at the time that Robert Smith onboarded, Robert Smith would be assigned the username “rsmith2”.The Account Managers manage VITG Cloud identifiers for users and devices Preventing reuse of user identifiers for at least two years, as follows:DevicesDevice names are selected and assigned by the implementer/integrator. The implementer will then submit a task to the Configuration Manager (CM), following KA 11638 for hardware, for the name(s) to be recorded in the CMDB. The CM will verify if there is an existing CI with the same hostname prior to adding the CI. This prevents device names from being re-used for the life of the system. If a device name is inserted into the CMDB that matches a previously selected device name, it will be listed as a duplicate name. In this case the Configuration-Change Manager alerts the assigned Engineer via email. The device name is updated to ensure non-duplication for the life of the hostname. Requests for Change may replace an existing device with an upgraded device using the same hostname.For VMs, the implementer will select and assign a hostname and the cloud automation tool will verify that the current vCenter environment does not contain an existing hostname prior to deploying a new VM. This will prevent duplicate hostnames from existing in vCenter. The cloud automation tool will then create a new CI entry into the CMDB for the newly deployed VM.UsersThe Account Managers prevent reuse of identifiers for users for at least two years. All account identifiers are retained in disabled status for at least two years after end of use. When a new account is needed, the software refuses to allow a duplicate. The Account Manager adds additional complexity to the new user’s identifier as described in part c of this control prior to assigning an identifier.The Account Managers manage VITG Cloud identifiers for users by disabling the identifier after sixty days for user identifiers and 60 days for device inactivity, as follows:The System Administrator configures Active Directory to automatically run a script that facilitates disabling user identifiers (accounts) after 60 days of inactivity. The script runs daily and produces a report showing accounts that have been inactive for 60 days or more. If any accounts are found, a Cherwell ticket is generated and the Account Manager reviews it to have those accounts disabled.Non-AD integrated appliances and devices are configured by the specific engineer to automatically disable user accounts after 60 days of inactivity.Device identifiers (host names, IP addresses) are not automatically disabled. Host names and IP addresses are tracked as part of the CMDB tracking process. As devices are decommissioned, the device identifiers are disabled.   ##

The RSA token and PIN are used to remotely access the jumpserver. Once the user accesses the jumpserver, they may access other resources by either using their Active Directory password (Windows and RHEL servers) or by using their password for non-AD integrated devices.Distributing Initial User Authenticators: PasswordsVITG Cloud users are provided with a VITG corporate email account through which corporate and other communications are conducted. Prior to onboarding with VITG, each employee’s identity is positively verified by the VITG Human Resources department by examining the employee’s government issued identification (e.g., driver license, state ID, military ID, passport, etc.). After positive identity is established, the employee is issued a VITG corporate email account with the following address format: firstname.lastname@VITG.com . Example: john.cavitt@VITG.com. Because of the identity verification process and the consistent email address format, VITG Cloud Account Managers have a reasonable process by which to verify a user’s identity in order to distribute initial account authenticators. When an account is set up in VITG Cloud (Active Directory and any non-AD integrated devices as applicable), the Account Manager sends the initial authenticator content (initial password) to the user via their VITG corporate email account.Distributing Initial User Authenticators: RSA TokensVITG Cloud users are issued RSA SecurID tokens that are either hardware tokens or soft tokens. Hard tokens are either distributed directly to the user in person by the Account Manager or are mailed to a physical address that the user provides to the Account Manager through their VITG corporate email account. The Account Manager sends the hardware token viaFedEx, or other delivery service provider. Token PINs are set up by the user upon first login. Tokens are distributed in a state where they are unusable until the user activates it by entering his or her user ID and token code to be permitted to configure the PIN. The PIN is a six digit code chosen by the user. Instructions to receive a soft token are emailed to the user via their corporate email address. The user downloads an RSA token application to their mobile device and must activate it using the information in the email.Group/Role AuthenticatorsVITG Cloud does not use group or role authenticators.Device AuthenticatorsDevice authenticators as defined by NIST SP 800-53 IA-5 supplemental guidance include certificates and passwords. Cloud Engineers and System Administrators are able to establish the identity of devices by using the device’s hostname and/or the device’s IP address. Devices use root passwords as authenticators. Access to root password for systems is defined in VITG Cloud Policy on Root Password Access. Effectively, the one-time passwords are stored in the Password Manager Pro system. Access to the passwords will be permitted by role based access to the system owners. Any use of the accounts must be documented with a ticket containing the system name, and reason for needing the root password. Once the password has been retrieved from the Password Manager and used, a new password must be generated. Root passwords must meet complexity and length requirements and per VITG Cloud process but be generated by an approved tool in the VITG Cloud MMS Suite of tools and updated within the Password Manager.The System Manager manages information system authenticators by establishing initial authenticator content for authenticators, as follows:Individual AuthenticatorsInitial account passwords are generated by the System Administrator in accordance with complexity rules described for IA-5(1). The password is sent to the user through email with no other identifying information.The tokens are distributed in a state where they are unusable until the recipient enters his or her user ID and token code to be permitted to configure the PIN. RSA’s SecurID binds user IDs to Token serial numbers. To initialize a Token, the user accesses the VITG Cloud VPN where he or she is prompted to enter the userID and the current code displayed on their token. If the code entered matches the expected code known by the RSA server for that token, the user is required to create a unique PIN code. If not, the attempt to authenticate is refused. Once that first authentication is successful, subsequent authentication requests must include the user ID, PIN, and token code.Device AuthenticatorsWhen a system has a root password configured, it is configured at installation time . The password complexity for root passwords is 14 characters long with at least one character meeting each of the following: upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. The password is stored in Password Manager Pro which enforces access control and the password complexity requirements.The System Manager manages information system authenticators by ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use, as follows:RSA is configured to require certain lengths of authenticators and also apply complexity requirements to user PIN codes. Token codes are 6 digits and change every 60 seconds. PIN codes are 8 digits. In conjunction with passwords, RSA token codes provide adequate strength of mechanisms for remote access to VITG Cloud.The RSA SecureID appliance does not accept PINs that do not meet the appropriate criteria.VITG Cloud administered Linux-based systems and Microsoft-based systems are all configured to apply complexity requirements to user passwords via GPO settings as required by STIG Vuln ID #V-1150. This setting ensures that AD integrated accounts (which are required to access the jumpserver and subsequently, the Cloud environment) meet the password complexity requirements cited as part of IA-5(1) and are, therefore, of sufficient strength of mechanism for the environment.Root Passwords must meet complexity and length requirements cited as part of IA-5(1) and must be generated by Password Manager Pro in the VITG Cloud MMS suite of tools.The System Manager manages information system authenticators by establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;Initial Authenticator DistributionFor individual authenticators, there are two components involved in authentication: 1) password; and 2) RSA SecurID token. The RSA token and PIN are used to remotely access the jumpserver. Once the user accesses the jumpserver, they may access other resources by either using their Active Directory password (Windows and RHEL servers) or by using their password for non-AD integrated devices.Distributing Initial User Authenticators: PasswordsVITG Cloud users are provided with a VITG corporate email account through which corporate and other communications are conducted. Prior to onboarding with VITG, each employee’s identity is positively verified by the VITG Human Resources department by examining the employee’s government issued identification (e.g., driver license, state ID, military ID, passport, etc.). After positive identity is established, the employee is issued a VITG corporate email account with the following address format: firstname.lastname@VITG.com . Example: john.cavitt@VITG.com. Because of the identity verification process and the consistent email address format, VITG Cloud Account Managers have a reasonable process by which to verify a user’s identity in order to distribute initial account authenticators. When an account is set up in VITG Cloud (Active Directory and any non-AD integrated devices as applicable), the Account Manager sends the initial authenticator content (initial password) to the user via their VITG corporate email account.Distributing Initial User Authenticators: RSA TokensVITG Cloud users are issued RSA SecurID tokens that are either hardware tokens or soft tokens. Hard tokens are either distributed directly to the user in person by the Account Manager or are mailed to a physical address that the user provides to the Account Manager through their VITG corporate email account. The Account Manager sends the hardware token via FedEx, or other delivery service provider. Token PINs are set up by the user upon first login. Tokens are distributed in a state where they are unusable until the user activates it by entering his or her user ID and token code to be permitted to configure the PIN. The PIN is an eight digit code chosen by the user. Instructions to receive a soft token are emailed to the user via their corporate email address. The user downloads an RSA token application to their mobile device and must activate it using the information in the email.Lost/Compromised or Damaged AuthenticatorsPasswordsIn the event a password becomes compromised, the user whose password became compromised must report the fact to the VITG Cloud service desk, generating a Cherwell incident. At any time the user may change his/her password unless the account has been locked out. If the account is locked out, the System Administrator unlocks the account, resets the password ensuring that the “change password on next login” box is checked. The System Administrator transmits the new temporary password to the user by sending an unmarked email to the user’s known VITG corporate email address. The user can log back into the system and must change their password upon login.RSA TokensIn the event a token becomes lost/compromised or damaged, the user must report the fact to the Cloud service desk. The System Administrator creates a Cherwell incident and assigns the incident ticket to the Network Operations Center to immediately disable the token in the RSA appliance. The user is then issued a new token according to the process outlined in the steps above. This process is the same for hard and soft tokens.Revoking AuthenticatorsAuthenticators are revoked in the following cases:A temporary or emergency account was established for maintenance or other purposes and is no longer needed. In this case, the Engineer working with the vendor creates a Cherwell incident ticket to have the account and its authenticator revoked. The account/authenticator is revoked in accordance with procedures outlined for AC-2.A user is terminated from the system. Procedures outlined for AC-2 are followed in this case.The System Manager manages information system authenticators by changing default content of authenticators prior to information system installation, as follows:Since RSA SecurID tokens (both hardware and software tokens) are time driven, there is no default content to replace.As part of the VITG Cloud build process, all other hardware “as shipped default” authenticators have been changed. This includes the RSA SecurID application and network devices.The Engineer responsible for the respective system ensures the appropriate hardening guidelines are followed and that default authenticators are changed.The System Manager manages information system authenticators by establishing minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse conditions for authenticators, as follows:RSA Tokens and PINsRSA Token PINs remain the same and, therefore, do not have a maximum lifetime; however, given the function of the tokens, each authentication credential has an enforced maximum lifetime restriction of 60 seconds. There is not a minimum lifetime restriction set for RSA tokens codes and PINs.Active Directory Account AuthenticatorsMinimum and Maximum Lifetime RestrictionsThe Windows Engineer has configured (as implemented for IA-5(1) part d) the Active Directory authenticators through the use of GPO settings as follows:Minimum lifetime restrictions1 dayMaximum lifetime restrictions60 daysConditions for Authenticator ReuseThe Windows Engineer has configured (as implemented for IA-5(1) part e) the Active Directory authenticators through the use of GPO settings as follows:Reuse conditionsPasswords may not be reused for 24 generationsThe System Manager manages information system authenticators by establishing a process to ensure that authenticators are changed/refreshed every 60 days for passwords.RSA Tokens and PINSRSA Token PINs remain the same and, therefore, are not refreshed; however, given the function of the tokens, each authentication credential has an enforced refresh rate of 60 seconds.Active Directory Account AuthenticatorsAccess to Windows, RHEL and Active Directory authenticated applications and services requires initial login using a valid MS Active Directory username and password. All MS Active Directory account passwords must be changed/refreshed every 60 days. This is enforced by GPO settings configured by the Windows Engineer. Password authentication is an additional step following multi-factor authentication through RSA.The System Manager manages information system authenticators by protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification, as follows:Individual Responsibilities (PL-4, PS-6)VITG Cloud Operations team members are instructed never to release their PIN or password to anyone, per VITG Cloud general acceptable use policy and VITG Cloud Rules of Behavior .Protection of Authenticators at RestWindows and RHEL OS protect authenticators stored within the servers by using a one-way hash. If the password files were to be compromised, the plaintext passwords would not be viewable. The Windows Engineer has configured the Windows server in accordance with STIG Vuln ID #V-2372 (Disable reversible password encryption). The Linux engineer has configured RHEL servers not to store passwords in the /etc/passwd file. All password hashes must be stored in the /etc/shadow file using the SHA512 hash (STIG vulnerability ID #’s V-38499, V38574, RHEL-07-010170, RHEL-07-010180).Protection of Authenticators in TransitThe Network Engineer has configured the VPN to encrypt all traffic in transit and thus includes PINs, tokens, and passwords, through the use of IPSec.The System Manager manages information system authenticators by requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific security safeguards to protect authenticators, as follows:The VITG Cloud Operations team members never release their PIN and account passwords to anyone, per VITG Cloud general acceptable use policy and VITG Cloud Rules of Behavior .“You must maintain the confidentiality of your authentication credentials such as your password. Do not reveal your authentication credentials to anyone; a General Dynamics IT employee should never ask you to reveal them.”Devices are configured to do hashing functions and encryption as described in part h above.The System Manager manages information system authenticators by changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership to those accounts changes, as follows:Engineers are responsible for the appropriate system accounts appropriate to their subject matter. When an engineer changes responsibility, the newly assigned engineer changes the password through Password Manager Pro to ensure the authenticators are changed as required   ##

Appliances and root passwords are required by policy, as stated in control IA-5 part b, to match the Active Directory password configuration. However, not all appliances have the technology to enforce this requirement. Desc:implemented-requirement control-id, description  ##

                     The VITG Cloud incident response procedures provide appropriate security incident documentation to FedRAMP and/or US-CERT reporting requirements. At the point in the incident response process where we have ascertained that the incident is not a false positive and have performed the appropriate triage, Security Analysts will follow the escalation process as defined for the incident type and notify the appropriate people/organizations as soon as possible.The ISSO reports security incident information to US government stakeholders including end-user agencies and US-CERT according to FedRAMP Incident Communications Procedure, as described in the VITG Cloud Incident Response Plan.The following table identifies the VITG Cloud security procedures that are used for responding to incidents as well as reporting incidents to the applicable stakeholders.

                     The VITG Cloud incident response procedures provide appropriate security incident documentation to FedRAMP and/or US-CERT reporting requirements. At the point in the incident response process where we have ascertained that the incident is not a false positive and have performed the appropriate triage, Security Analysts will follow the escalation process as defined for the incident type and notify the appropriate people/organizations as soon as possible.   ##

All functions performed by the DCIRT are primarily and fundamentally in line with the six-step FISMA theoretical model which encompasses Prevention, Detection, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Follow-up. The VITG Cloud Incident Response Plan contains the following items:IntroductionVITG Cloud Policies and ProceduresTrainingSecurity ExercisesIncident Management OverviewThe Resources and Management SupportOrganizational StructureCritical Security Incident Response Team Contact ListRoles and ResponsibilitiesStructure and Organization of the Incident Response CapabilityRoadmap for implementing the VITG Cloud incident response capabilityIncident Response Capability for the VITG CloudIncident Response Capability for the CustomerVITG Cloud ToolsIncident Reporting and Tracking ToolsSystem Monitoring ToolsSecurity Incident Response – High-Level Process WorkflowIncident Response HandlingIncident Response ReportingIncident TrackingIncident Response AssistanceExternal Information SourcesInternal Information ResourcesIncident Response MetricsPlan TestingVITG Cloud Incident Response (IR) Plan ReviewAPPENDIX A: Customer Point of Contact InformationAPPENDIX B: Vendor Point of Contact Information(2) The IR Plan describes the structure and organization of the incident response capability. The VITG Cloud leverages the processes in VITG Cloud Policy on Security Incident Response to guide our team’s response to incidents irrespective of client. This incident response policy provides VITG Cloud with a roadmap for implementing its incident response capability and describes the structure and organization of the incident response capability.Within the VITG Cloud Operations organizational structure, the SOC Analysts provide monitoring and analysis for network traffic and endpoint events. Once an incident is identified, it is identified as one of six categories in (See Table 4.1). The category of the incident is directly related to the risk it poses to the Data Center environment and operational mission.At this point, the VITG Cloud SOC performs incident response activities. A risk assessment is performed for each incident that includes determining the incident’s characteristics (e.g. target system(s) involved, source of incident, type of incident) as compared to the incident’s severity, which is a composite function of the potential customer business impact of the incident and the level of exposure. Once the determination has been made of the incident’s origin, a custom signature will be developed for deployment throughout the VITG Cloud infrastructure to prevent reoccurrence. Using this repeatable lifecycle approach to VITG Cloud incidents will keep the Data Center on the leading edge of security.After each incident, the SOC will conduct a lessons learned meeting to review events from ongoing incident handling activities and to incorporate the resulting changes into incident response procedures, training, and testing/exercises.Proven and repeatable processes will ensure that the VITG Cloud infrastructure continues to be protected against new and evolving threats. The OCIRT follows VITG SEC-PRO-IT-73.1 INCIDENT RESPONSE process and adopted comprehensive process, based on industry best practices to manage an incident throughout its lifecycle. This process is based on the six-step NIST theoretical model that encompasses Preparation, Detection and Analysis, Containment, Eradication, Recovery and Post-Incident Activities. Security incidents are tracked via ticketing software in Cherwell. Security Incident Response procedures guide SOC (Security Operations Center) personnel through the security incident response process.(3) The IR Plan provides a high-level approach for how the incident response capability fits into the overall organization, as follows:VITG Cloud Operations follows the VITG Cloud Incident Response Plan process to manage an incident throughout its lifecycle. This process is based on the 6-step FISMA theoretical model which encompasses Prevention, Detection, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Follow-up. Proven and repeatable processes will ensure that the Data Center infrastructure continues to be protected against new and evolving threats.Within the VITG Cloud Operations organizational structure, the SOC Analysts provide monitoring and analysis for network traffic and endpoint events. Once an incident is identified, it is prioritized into one of six categories listed in VITG Cloud Incident Response Plan. The category of the incident is directly related to the risk it poses to the Cloud environment and operational mission.At this point, the VITG Cloud Incident Response Team (DCIRT) performs incident response activities. A risk assessment is performed for each incident that includes determining the incident’s characteristics (e.g. target system(s) involved, source of incident, type of incident) as compared to the incident’s severity, which is a composite function of the potential Customer business impact of the incident and the level of exposure. Once the determination has been made of the incident’s origin, a custom signature will be developed for deployment throughout the VITG Cloud IaaS to prevent reoccurrence.Security incidents are tracked by the VITG Cloud MMS Ticketing system. Security Incident templates guide DCIRT personnel through the security incident response process as defined in the VITG Cloud Incident Response Plan .After each incident, the DCIRT will conduct a Lessons Learned meeting to review events from ongoing incident handling activities and incorporate into incident response procedures, training, and testing/exercises, and implements the resulting changes accordingly.(4) The IR Plan meets the unique requirements of the organization, which relate to mission, size, structure, and functions. The DCIRT reports suspected security incidents to the HCSD organization elements responsible for incident response capability within organization-defined time periods listed in the VITG Cloud Incident Response Plan. Customer system-specific Incident Response reporting time periods will be established during the Customer On-boarding process.At the top is VITG IT Security. VITG IT Security coordinates security incidents internally and externally.Below is the division level HCSD Security. HCSD Security provides information to HCSD management and VITG IT Security on all security incidents.At the root of the organizational structure is VITG Cloud Operations. The VITG Cloud Incident Response Team (DCIRT) performs Incident response activities in accordance with VITG Cloud policy, applicable standards, and program requirements. The DCIRT reports Incidents to HCSD Security who reports to the JAB.(5) The IR Plan defines reportable Incidents as listed in the Table below.
                        
Unauthorized Access
                     
                        
A person gains logical access without permission to the HCSD network, system, application, data, or other technical resource, which includes any incident with evidence of data exfiltration or manipulation.
                     
                        
Denial of Service (DoS)
                     
                        
An attack that prevents or impairs the authorized use of networks, systems, or applications by exhausting resources. This activity includes being the victim of, or participating in, a DoS attack.

                     (6) The IR Plan provides metrics for measuring the incident response capability within the organization as follows:IR-1 Notification of Critical Infrastructure Faults100% notifications within one hourUsing email and VITG Cloud MMS Ticketing systemIR-2 Security Event Detection90% detected within 30 minutesUsing VITG Cloud MMS Ticketing system to document the anomalyIR-3 Security Event Analysis to determine risk of potential anomaly90% Initiated within 30 minutes from detectionUsing VITG Cloud MMS Ticketing system to document the initial analysisIR-4 Quarantine of Suspect System if security incident is determined95% completed within 60 minutesUsing VITG Cloud MMS Ticketing system, Documented coordinated actions taken to quarantine of validated compromiseIR-5 Security Event Analysis Status Reporting95 % within 1 hour after determination of a security incidentUsing email and VITG Cloud MMS Ticketing system, provide a status update to VITG Security ManagementIR-6 Security Anomaly Investigation Report as a final analysis90% within 10 daysUsing Word template for documentation of a validated security incident attached to VITG Cloud MMS Incident Ticket(7) The IR Plan defines the resources and management support needed to effectively maintain and mature an incident response capability. VITG management supports the VITG Cloud as a core business goal. Its support for an effective and efficient incident response capability is clearly in line with this goal. To respond quickly to potential incidents requires both automation and personnel. VITG management has procured the technology to automate VITG Cloud’s Incident Response capability and has provided the VITG Cloud SOC personnel to implement this incident response plan.(8) This IR Plan is reviewed and approved for implementation by the following designated organizational officials: System Manager and the ISSO.The Security Operations Manager securely distributes copies of Incident Response Plan (IR Plan) to the Incident Response Team identified in Section 2.3 of the VITG Cloud Incident Response Plan . The IR Plan is distributed securely via Cherwell (through the KA) and through the internal SharePoint site. The JAB is included in the distribution via upload to MAX.gov.

                     The Security Operations Manager defines a list of incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements. The incident response list includes designated FedRAMP personnel.The Security Operations Manager reviews the VITG Incident Response Plan annually:The annual reviews are initiated by the VITG Cloud Security Calendar as well as embedded into Cherwell as a documentation review task. On an annual basis, the Knowledge Manager assigns a reviewer and places the KA in their review queue in the tool. The reviewer reads through the document and identifies any errors or inconsistencies with current practice or team membership. The reviewer makes updates to resolve the wording and updates the Document Revision History.All changes to the document are then reviewed by the Knowledge Manager. The results of the review are recorded both in the document change page and in the Cherwell ticket.The Security Operations Manager updates the incident response plan to address system/organizational changes or problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testing. These changes are then communicated to the individuals that form the Incident Response Team as part of the annual IR Training.The VITG Cloud Incident Response Plan is updated as needed to address changes to the organization, information system, or environment of operation; and problems encountered during incident response.The Security Operations Manager submits a ticket, then the document is updated by the ISSO and System Manager or other roles involved in the specific update and then is approved.Updates are required in order to ensure changes are reflected in the document, to include the following:Organization changes: additions or removals of personnel or rolesEnvironment of operation changes: removal or additional of components or capabilitiesSystem/organizational changes or problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testingThe Security Operations Manager communicates incident response plan changes to the Incident Response team identified in Section 2.4 of the IR Plan, when changes are required. The IR Plan is maintained in Cherwell, which tracks the updates and approvals of any changes. In addition, any change to the IR Plan requires CMB approval and the approvals are documented in change management board minutes.The VITG Cloud defines a list of incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements. The incident response list includes designated FedRAMP personnel.The Security Operations Manager protects the incident response plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification by ensuring that it is maintained on the secure VITG Cloud SharePoint site, which is internal to VITG and is access controlled.   ##

All functions performed by the DCIRT are primarily and fundamentally in line with the six-step FISMA theoretical model which encompasses Prevention, Detection, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Follow-up.

The VITG Cloud leverages the processes in VITG Cloud Policy on Security Incident Response to guide our team’s response to incidents irrespective of client. This incident response policy provides VITG Cloud with a roadmap for implementing its incident response capability and describes the structure and organization of the incident response capability.Within the VITG Cloud Operations organizational structure, the SOC Analysts provide monitoring and analysis for network traffic and endpoint events. Once an incident is identified, it is identified as one of six categories in (See Table 4.1). The category of the incident is directly related to the risk it poses to the Data Center environment and operational mission.At this point, the VITG Cloud SOC performs incident response activities. A risk assessment is performed for each incident that includes determining the incident’s characteristics (e.g. target system(s) involved, source of incident, type of incident) as compared to the incident’s severity, which is a composite function of the potential customer business impact of the incident and the level of exposure. Once the determination has been made of the incident’s origin, a custom signature will be developed for deployment throughout the VITG Cloud infrastructure to prevent reoccurrence. Using this repeatable lifecycle approach to VITG Cloud incidents will keep the Data Center on the leading edge of security.After each incident, the SOC will conduct a lessons learned meeting to review events from ongoing incident handling activities and to incorporate the resulting changes into incident response procedures, training, and testing/exercises.Proven and repeatable processes will ensure that the VITG Cloud infrastructure continues to be protected against new and evolving threats. The OCIRT follows VITG SEC-PRO-IT-73.1 INCIDENT RESPONSE process and adopted comprehensive process, based on industry best practices to manage an incident throughout its lifecycle. This process is based on the six-step NIST theoretical model that encompasses Preparation, Detection and Analysis, Containment, Eradication, Recovery and Post-Incident Activities. Security incidents are tracked via ticketing software in Cherwell. Security Incident Response procedures guide SOC (Security Operations Center) personnel through the security incident response process.(3) The IR Plan provides a high-level approach for how the incident response capability fits into the overall organization, as follows:VITG Cloud Operations follows the VITG Cloud Incident Response Plan process to manage an incident throughout its lifecycle.

Proven and repeatable processes will ensure that the Data Center infrastructure continues to be protected against new and evolving threats.Within the VITG Cloud Operations organizational structure, the SOC Analysts provide monitoring and analysis for network traffic and endpoint events. Once an incident is identified, it is prioritized into one of six categories listed in VITG Cloud Incident Response Plan. The category of the incident is directly related to the risk it poses to the Cloud environment and operational mission.At this point, the VITG Cloud Incident Response Team (DCIRT) performs incident response activities. A risk assessment is performed for each incident that includes determining the incident’s characteristics (e.g. target system(s) involved, source of incident, type of incident) as compared to the incident’s severity, which is a composite function of the potential Customer business impact of the incident and the level of exposure. Once the determination has been made of the incident’s origin, a custom signature will be developed for deployment throughout the VITG Cloud IaaS to prevent reoccurrence.Security incidents are tracked by the VITG Cloud MMS Ticketing system. Security Incident templates guide DCIRT personnel through the security incident response process as defined in the VITG Cloud Incident Response Plan .After each incident, the DCIRT will conduct a Lessons Learned meeting to review events from ongoing incident handling activities and incorporate into incident response procedures, training, and testing/exercises, and implements the resulting changes accordingly.(4) The IR Plan meets the unique requirements of the organization, which relate to mission, size, structure, and functions. The DCIRT reports suspected security incidents to the HCSD organization elements responsible for incident response capability within organization-defined time periods listed in the VITG Cloud Incident Response Plan. Customer system-specific Incident Response reporting time periods will be established during the Customer On-boarding process.At the top is VITG IT Security. VITG IT Security coordinates security incidents internally and externally.Below is the division level HCSD Security. HCSD Security provides information to HCSD management and VITG IT Security on all security incidents.At the root of the organizational structure is VITG Cloud Operations. The VITG Cloud Incident Response Team (DCIRT) performs Incident response activities in accordance with VITG Cloud policy, applicable standards, and program requirements. The DCIRT reports Incidents to HCSD Security who reports to the JAB.(5) The IR Plan defines reportable Incidents as listed in the Table below.
                        
Unauthorized Access
                     
                        
A person gains logical access without permission to the HCSD network, system, application, data, or other technical resource, which includes any incident with evidence of data exfiltration or manipulation.
                     
                        
Denial of Service (DoS)
                     
                        
An attack that prevents or impairs the authorized use of networks, systems, or applications by exhausting resources. This activity includes being the victim of, or participating in, a DoS attack.
                     
                        
Malicious Code
                     
                        
Successful installation of malicious software (e.g., virus, worm, Trojan horse, or other code-based malicious entity) that infects an operating system or application. This category includes hosts exhibiting beaconing or control host activity. BUs are NOT required to report malicious logic that has been successfully quarantined or mitigated by malicious code detection software.
                     
                        
Inappropriate Usage
                     
                        
A person violates acceptable use of any network or computer use policies.
                     
                        
Scans/Probes/Attempted Access
                     
                        
Includes any activity that seeks to access or identify a BU computer, open ports, protocols, service, or any combination for later exploit. This activity does not directly result in a compromise or denial of service.
                     
                        
Investigation
                     
                        
Unconfirmed incidents that are potentially malicious or anomalous activity deemed by the reporting entity to warrant further review.
                     (6) The IR Plan provides metrics for measuring the incident response capability within the organization as follows:IR-1 Notification of Critical Infrastructure Faults100% notifications within one hourUsing email and VITG Cloud MMS Ticketing systemIR-2 Security Event Detection90% detected within 30 minutesUsing VITG Cloud MMS Ticketing system to document the anomalyIR-3 Security Event Analysis to determine risk of potential anomaly90% Initiated within 30 minutes from detectionUsing VITG Cloud MMS Ticketing system to document the initial analysisIR-4 Quarantine of Suspect System if security incident is determined95% completed within 60 minutesUsing VITG Cloud MMS Ticketing system, Documented coordinated actions taken to quarantine of validated compromiseIR-5 Security Event Analysis Status Reporting95 % within 1 hour after determination of a security incidentUsing email and VITG Cloud MMS Ticketing system, provide a status update to VITG Security ManagementIR-6 Security Anomaly Investigation Report as a final analysis90% within 10 daysUsing Word template for documentation of a validated security incident attached to VITG Cloud MMS Incident Ticket(7) The IR Plan defines the resources and management support needed to effectively maintain and mature an incident response capability. VITG management supports the VITG Cloud as a core business goal. Its support for an effective and efficient incident response capability is clearly in line with this goal.

Once the access is verified, the FSO sends a request to VITG corporate to have the employee’s badge added to the access list for the specific area.Controlling Ingress/Egress to the FacilityThe defined entry/exit points to the facilities and how ingress/egress is controlled for each follows:Access to the VITG Cloud West data center is through doors 2, 4, and 5.Door 2 (Primary data center access)Requires proximity card accessAccess is monitored through badge activityCCTV monitoredDoor 3 (Data center emergency exit only)Access from the outside has been disabled (door handle removed and replaced with a plate)Door is locked from the insideDoor is sensored, alarmed, and CCTV monitoredDoor 4 (UPS room)Requires proximity card accessAccess is monitored through badge activityCCTV monitoredDoor 5 (UPS room exterior door)Mechanical door lockSensored and CCTV monitoredThe data center administrative, Service Desk, NOC, and SOC areas are also controlled by an electronic access system that is maintained by VITG Headquarters in Virginia.There are proximity card readers and locks to the building’s perimeter that are on a separate access control system, and it is maintained by a commercial real estate management service. The building’s perimeter doors are unlocked during each business day from 6 AM to 8 PM and are programmed to lock automatically off-hours and weekends. These doors are also monitored by the same commercial real estate management service.The VITG Cloud Operations Center is occupied by VITG Employees performing the role of Technical Support. This area is restricted to VITG personnel and vendors who are authorized to work in this area, or have a valid business reason to be in this area. The data center floor houses the hardware used to provide services to customers. This area is restricted to VITG personnel and vendors who are authorized to work in this area. The Communications closet and PBX room house voice and network communication equipment. These areas are restricted to VITG personnel and vendors who are authorized to work in these areas.VITG Cloud EastVerifying Individual Access AuthorizationsPrior to requesting access for an employee or contractor, the FSO verifies the individual is authorized to access the physical area for which they are requesting access. Once the access is verified, the FSO sends a request to COPT to have a badge created and added to the access list for the specific area.Controlling Ingress/Egress to the FacilityThe facility has four areas that control ingress/egress to the East facility:Entrance to the data center compound. This regulates access to the outside of the data center building including the parking area. This is monitored and controlled by security guard staff 24x7.Entrance to the building. This is monitored and controlled by security guard staff 24x7.Entrance to the data center. Access to this area requires badge access and biometrics.Entrance to the VITG data center cage. Access to this area requires badge access and biometrics.The VITG Cloud East resides in a secure facility that includes: vehicle arrest barriers, K12 rated perimeter fencing, guarded entrances, multiple recorded video surveillance zones, facility access control via a badge access card access system, biometric authentication for VITG suites, man traps, continuous monitoring, and 24x7 on premise security personnel and staffing. All exit doors are alarmed.Physical access audit logs are maintained for the following entry/exit points :VITG Cloud WestVITG corporate maintains the physical access audit logs for the Cloud West facility as part of their physical security controls. The following entry/exit points generate audit logs that are maintained by VITG corporate:Data center administrative areaTwo badge access doorsData center SOC/NOC areaTwo badge access doorsDoor #2 (Primary data center access)Door #4 (UPS room)On a monthly basis, VITG corporate sends the FSO badge access activity reports (audit logs) for review that show which badges were used to access which area and when (date/time).VITG Cloud EastCOPT maintains the physical access audit logs for badge accesses to the data center area and to the VITG cage inside the data center. On a monthly basis, COPT sends the FSO the badge access activity report (audit logs) for review that shows badge activity for the VITG cage and Cage in a Cage inside the data center.The FSO provides security safeguards to control access to areas officially designated as publicly accessible, as appropriate, in accordance with the system’s assessment of risk.VITG Cloud WestAccess to common areas is controlled by entry from the parking lot to the front door and a log of visitors in that area is kept and sent to the ISSO monthly. The Lobby of the facility is the primary location for all individuals entering the center. All secure entry and exit points have electronic badge readers and monitoring via video camera surveillance.VITG Cloud EastThe VITG Cloud East provides a layered defense for physical security of the data center. All areas of the site require controlled access. There is no public space within 150 feet of the building. Access to the area where the VITG Cloud data center cages reside is controlled by a proxcard and biometric authentication. All visitors are questioned and authenticated via an identity verification system. Security guard team must open the door. Access to the data center where VITG Cloud resides (Level 3), and all ingress and egress points are controlled by a card reader (depending on physical access restrictions) and there are biometrics locks (Finger Print) on the cage doors. The card reader is controlled by a terminal in the security center that maintains logs of who has accessed, which doors, and successful and unsuccessful access attempts.Guests are on a guest list for the day, The FSO provides the list to the site security guard staff. Guests are required to provide government issued identification documentation to the guard and VITG escort must validate before the guard will issue a visitor badge that allows them to access the main hall. The badge enables the Guest to pass though the man-trap. From there the VITG escort will take over.According to Physical And Environmental Protection Standard Operations Procedure, the FSO requires escorts for visitors and monitors visitor activity in all circumstances within restricted access area where the information system resides.The visitor is required to sign-in before being assigned an escortThe visitor is assigned an escort that must be with the visitor at all times within the Cloud facilityThe visitor is required to sign-out when leaving the Cloud facilityVITG Cloud WestThe FSO secures keys, combinations, and other physical access devices by use of a centrally-managed and controlled key lockbox in NOC and SOC and secure combinations by placing them in locked containers.VITG Cloud EastCOPT manages and ensures that the following physical access devices are secure at the East facility:Badge readersBiometric finger scannersVITG Cloud WestThe FSO conducts an annual inventory of badge readers, and keys at the West facility.VITG Cloud EastCOPT conducts a monthly inventory of badge readers and biometric scanners.VITG Cloud WestThe FSO changes combinations and keys when access keys are lost or combinations are compromised, as follows:Access to the VITG Cloud West assets is managed solely by badge access control devices. There are no keys used to access the VITG Cloud components. See the process of physical access written in PE-3.VITG Cloud uses a combination safe to store authorized media (see MP-4 for details). The Facilities Manager ensures that the combination is changed on an annual basis or in the event that the combination is compromised, or individuals are transferred or terminated.VITG Cloud EastAccess to the VITG Cloud East assets is managed solely by badge and biometric access control devices.

Examples of anomalous activities include but are not limited to: 1) access during non-business hours to areas typically not accessed during those times; 2) access by personnel who do not typically access an area (though they may have been granted access); and/or 3) multiple failed access attempts (failed badge swipes) to an area at any time. If the activity cannot be associated with known/approved maintenance activities, the FSO follows up with the employee’s supervisor to determine the cause of the anomaly.Through CCTV cameras set up as described in PE-3, the FSO can also review footage of the date/time the anomalous activity was detected. Additionally, monitors showing the live feed of the various CCTV cameras are set up on the NOC area, allowing NOC personnel to view activity in those areas 24x7.The surveillance cameras provide continuous coverage of the data center entry/exit points and automatically commence recording when motion is detected. If an incident is detected through another means (e.g., SIEM solution), if needed, the FSO can view footage of the specific area concerned based on the date/time stamp. This enhances the incident response capability for physical as well as logical security incidents, if needed.VITG Cloud EastCameras and access control systems are monitored 24x7 by the COPT Security Guards.The VITG Cloud ISSO reviews physical access logs on a monthly basis for the areas described in PE-3 to determine if any anomalous activities occurred.

If the activity cannot be associated with known/approved maintenance activities, the ISSO follows up with the employee’s supervisor to determine the cause of the anomaly. In the event the cause is unapproved, open an incident ticket. The incident ticket process is consistent with processes described in the IR family of controls, specifically IR-4 Incident Handling within this document.VITG Cloud WestThe ISSO also reviews physical access logs in the event of a suspected physical access incident or other event. Examples of these potential indications of events include but are not limited to:Maintenance and/or visitor logs are not completed or are inconsistent;Hardware is reported missing and there is no ticketing record for its removal;Hardware is out of place (e.g., rack doors opened for unknown reason); orA door alarm is tripped.Additionally, any of the above events can be further investigated by reviewing the CCTV recorded events according to date/time stamp.VITG Cloud EastCOPT provides physical access logs to the FSO on a monthly basis.

If the activity cannot be associated with known/approved maintenance activities, the ISSO follows up with the employee’s supervisor to determine the cause of the anomaly. In the event the cause is unapproved, open an incident ticket. The incident ticket process is consistent with processes described in the IR family of controls, specifically IR-4 Incident Handling within this document.VITG Cloud WestThe ISSO also reviews physical access logs in the event of a suspected physical access incident or other event. Examples of these potential indications of events include but are not limited to:Maintenance and/or visitor logs are not completed or are inconsistent;Hardware is reported missing and there is no ticketing record for its removal;Hardware is out of place (e.g., rack doors opened for unknown reason); orA door alarm is tripped.Additionally, any of the above events can be further investigated by reviewing the CCTV recorded events according to date/time stamp.VITG Cloud EastCOPT provides physical access logs to the FSO on a monthly basis. The logs provided are as follows:VITG HCSD - Cage 203E - history of access to the VITG floorVITG HCSD – Cage in a cage – history of access to the inner cageVITG HCSD Visitor log - history of escorted visitors COPT provides 24x7 on-site monitoring of the East facility to include the data center room and the cage in which VITG Cloud assets are deployed. VITG Cloud SOC personnel contact COPT security personnel in the event that anomalous system activity is observed on or related to Manassas deployed assets. In this case COPT reviews their access logs to determine if there was an associated physical access of the VITG Cloud East cage at that time. Desc:implemented-requirement control-id, description  ##

The SSP is maintained on the access controlled internal SharePoint site and is posted to Cherwell as the official change to the document. This is captured in KA 11106 VITG Cloud System Security Plan (11/28/2016) Note: The KA date is updated with the submission of this version of the document.The Cloud ISSO reviews the security plan for the information system at least annually as part of continuous monitoring.The ISSO intiates the annual SSP reviewthrough the VITG Cloud Security Calendar that is maintained on the VITG Cloud SharePoint site. Changes to documentation are governed by the change management process and are approved by the CAB, and by ISSO and System Owner on the signature page of this document.. The results of the review are recorded both in the change/version section of the SSP and in the Cherwell ticket.The Cloud ISSO updates the plan to address changes to the information system/environment of operation or problems identified during plan implementation or security control assessments.Any change in security controls must be approved by PMO prior to implementation and then documented in the VITG Cloud SSP. Significant changes to the system may require the completion of a new VITG Cloud A&A. The ISSO notifies the FedRAMP ISSO when any PMO-approved updates or changes to the SSP have been completed.All identified changes are submitted as change requests that are managed by the change management process. If approved, the changes to the document are managed by the configuration management process, which governs document version control.To protect the VITG Cloud System Security Plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification, the ISSO maintains the authorized version in the access controlled VITG Cloud internal SharePoint site. Additionally, as updated versions of the SSP are released, the ISSO uploads them to the access controlled MAX.gov site for FedRAMP authorized systems.   ##

                     Assigning a risk designation to all positions and establishing screening criteria is required by GSA policy GSA IT Security Policy, GSA Order CIO P 2100.1G and procedures.Position Categorization and associated criteria for screening VITG employees is consistent with 5 CFR 731.106(a) / OPM policy and guidance.The VITG ISSO has decided to take a high water mark approach and screen all employees and contractors as though their job role carried a “high risk” and requires all our employees to be subject to a Background Investigation before hire date. The Screening Criteria are outlined below:Identification verificationSSN verificationEducation verificationNational criminal file searchPast employment verificationAnything beyond these is driven by our additional customer requirements.The ISSO and System Owner review and update position risk designations on an annual basis as part of the Continuous Monitoring program as dictated by the Security Calendar. The ISSO initiates the review in conjunction with the annual SSP review and update. The ISSO updates the roles and risk designations then sends the updated version to the System Owner for review and approval.   ##

The ISSO will review and update this policy as required or at least annually.The ISSO has developed specific procedures for implementing VITG Cloud’s formal Risk Assessment controls in the Cloud’s VITG-OC-PRO-RA, Risk Assessment Procedures.The ISSO reviews and updates the policy and procedure as required or at least annually. Both the policy and procedures documents are managed by the change management process. Therefore, the review process is as follows:Knowledge Manager receives an automated notification when the Knowledge Article (KA), with associated policy is 30 days out from annual review.Knowledge Manager assigns the review to the ISSO and places the KA in the review queue in the tool.During the review, if the ISSO needs to make an update to the KA, the document change process is followed:The knowledge manager unlocks the baseline version of the document from the CMDB and sends to the ISSOThe ISSO updates the document and submits a change request, which goes through CAB approval.After CAB approval the document is sent to the knowledge managerThe Knowledge Manager locks the new baseline word document and attaches it to the CI record in the CMDBThe Knowledge Manger creates a PDF from the word document and attaches it to the associate Knowledge Article.The Knowledge Manager changes the KA’s review date to the following year.

CCE identifiers are associated with configuration statements and configuration controls that express the way humans name and discuss their intentions when configuring computer systems (see CCE Editorial Policies for detailed content decisions). In this way, the use of CCE-IDs as tags provide a bridge between natural language, prose-based configuration guidance documents and machine-readable or executable capabilities such as configuration audit tools.

Enumerates platforms
                     The tools combine the knowledge about many different operating systems and businesses to ensure up to data interoperability. The tools include functions to automate the scanning of the endpoints and delivery of the reports to a specified email distribution list. The tools are configured to download updates from the vendors to ensure the vulnerabilities that they scan include the latest discoveries.Security Engineers use these tools and the scan process to measure vulnerability impact by giving every flaw listed a CVSS score (1-10). The score is also translated in the POAM as low, moderate, or high.ReportingThe scans produce a report that enumerates platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations that includes the flaw, the flaw source, and flaw description on every device.The VITG Cloud ISSO uses the scan results to report the flaws to the FedRAMP PMO in an XML format upload a report to MAX every month.Security Analysts analyze vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments to identify legitimate vulnerabilities. The results of the scans are retained and traceable by sending reports through the VITG Cloud MMS Ticketing System to the appropriate owner of the technology. False positives are documented with a Deviation Request submitted to the FedRAMP JAB.Technology Engineers then determine the resolution and document the solution in the VITG Cloud MMS Ticketing System ticket. The options for resolution are:Fix the vulnerabilities through the use of patches, new versions, and hot fixes.Mitigate the vulnerability in order to lessen the impact the vulnerability has on the system.Document the vulnerability in the POA&M ticket, Identify what action will be taken in the future to resolve the vulnerability or document the reason why the vulnerability might remain a residual risk.These resolutions are included in the POA&M list loaded in Max every month.When this process has been completed Security Analysts will compare the documented actions with the results of the next scheduled scan to validate what vulnerabilities have been mitigated and what vulnerabilities are still on the system. For more detail, see Part d.VITG Security Analysts review all vulnerabilities identified from automated scans and security assessments. Legitimate vulnerabilities are assigned a severity rating and response time. Vulnerabilities are added to the POA&M and are tracked along with a high level strategy and measurable milestones through resolution. High risk vulnerabilities are required to be remediated within 30 days of discovery, while all moderate risk vulnerabilities are required to be remediated within 90 days of discovery. The vulnerabilities and their remediation processes are tracked internally by System Administrators via Cherwell ticketing System while the VITG Cloud ISSO tracks and reports all security assessment findings in the VITG Cloud POA&M list.The primary means of detection are through internal program reviews, information security audits, security assessments, security impact analyses, and continuous monitoring activities. Documented weaknesses are used to determine the appropriate strategy for risk mitigation by defining clear, measurable milestones, the required resources, and target completion dates. The VITG Cloud ISSO works with the respective Subject Matter Experts (SME) to correct the reported weakness and residual risks in a timely manner.The VITG Cloud ISSO reviews the POA&M list to ensure that it is in compliance with the FedRAMP standards.The ISSO shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control assessments by distributing vulnerability information to all engineers throughout the organization to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies). The distribution is accomplished by the following:VITG Cloud MMS ticketing system; with searchable recordsMonthly meetings with the Principle Director, Cloud Operations; this role is the Risk Executive, see Tables 2-6 and 3-1.The FedRAMP PMO through the monthly POA&M list upload to MAX.gov.The internal distribution is as follows:SecurityCenter: Daniel Galecki, Peter Harroun, Scott Hinck, Brian Borland, Hunter McCallum, Aaron Hernandez, Matt Holcomb, Kyle Barton, Sara Goldberg, Kimberly Robinson, Ashley Current, Trevor OuelletteAcunetix, as documented in KA 11286, How To: FedRAMP - Web Application scanning : FedRAMP ISSO, OMNI Director of Engineering, ConMon Project Manager.   ##

In this way, the use of CCE-IDs as tags provide a bridge between natural language, prose-based configuration guidance documents and machine-readable or executable capabilities such as configuration audit tools.

                     The tools combine the knowledge about many different operating systems and businesses to ensure up to data interoperability. The tools include functions to automate the scanning of the endpoints and delivery of the reports to a specified email distribution list. The tools are configured to download updates from the vendors to ensure the vulnerabilities that they scan include the latest discoveries.Security Engineers use these tools and the scan process to measure vulnerability impact by giving every flaw listed a CVSS score (1-10). The score is also translated in the POAM as low, moderate, or high.ReportingThe scans produce a report that enumerates platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations that includes the flaw, the flaw source, and flaw description on every device.The VITG Cloud ISSO uses the scan results to report the flaws to the FedRAMP PMO in an XML format upload a report to MAX every month.

Network Engineers apply the appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs) to ensure that traffic flow communications are directed to the approved Ports, Protocols, and services.Key Internal Boundaries: The Traffic Controller Firewall is the inside boundary protection and has three contexts (Virtual Firewalls): Tech Services, Customers 1, and Customers 2. The Traffic Controller Firewall directs traffic into the appropriate VLAN. Network Engineers configure each customer to have its own set of VLANs on the firewall. At the VM level, the VITG Cloud enforces a policy of no direct VM-to-VM communication on the public interfaces unless mediated by the CISCO ASA internal firewalls. This communication is prohibited through the imposition of ACL restrictions. The firewall is configured to Deny IP any any log and no VLAN-to-VLAN communication is permitted.To monitor the communications, Network Engineers installed IDS modules on the CISCO ASA Firewalls, which inspect the content permitted by Access Control Lists against a list of known signatures. The signatures are updated on a weekly basis. The alerts from the IDS are fed into the VITG Cloud MMS for review.Network Engineers implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are logically separated from internal organizational networks through the Traffic Controller Firewall that is the inside boundary protection and which has three contexts (Virtual Firewalls): Tech Services, Customers 1, and Customers 2.The Traffic Controller Firewall directs traffic into the appropriate VLAN. Network Engineers configures each Customer with its own set of VLANs on the firewall. This includes a the VITG Cloud policy enforcement of no direct VM-to-VM communication on the public interfaces unless mediated by the CISCO ASA internal firewalls, which is prohibited through the imposition of ACL restrictions, Deny IP any any log, and no VLAN-to-VLAN communication.The VITG Cloud network team manages the Border Guard firewall by the VITG Cloud through a set of commands to implement IPsec tunnels, VPNs, and rules that define ports and protocols to external networks. The VITG Cloud security architecture requires that all external connecting communications have a Border Guard firewall as its boundary protection.The VITG Cloud connects to external networks or information systems only through managed interfaces consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with organizational security architecture that includes t wo distinct networks:Internal: Connects the data centers to form the CloudExternal: Connects the Cloud to the InternetAll external access passes through the VITG Cloud Border Guard. The VITG Cloud leverages the RSA SecureID infrastructure to provide Authentication and Authorization services as identified in the AC controls.   ##

Flaws are identified if a component tests positive with the new plugins.Indications and warning alert messages from United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)Security Engineers consult the US-CERT website and also receive email notifications from the site.Reports from VendorsVendors periodically send emails on threats, vulnerabilities, and flaws that have been discovered on their products.Proactive scans based on news of current threats and system issues.Ad-hoc scans can be run at any time as needed in addition to the scheduled scans.The tool used to perform the scan is Security Center.Security Analysts report the flaws by entering a ticket into the VITG Cloud ticketing system for submission and tracking of incidents, requests, problems, and changes during the systems lifecycle, including flaws uncovered in scanning. The ticket is assigned to the appropriate Engineer, depending on the component affected. The Engineer corrects the flaw and sends the ticket back to the CAB for closure.In addition, VITG Cloud subscribes to vendor security notices of vendors that supplied the various system components that are received by System Administrators. These notices detail vendor identified software defects that result in patches to operating systems, applications, and device firmware. The following are the vendors’ websites/advisories to whom the System Administrators subscribe:Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts (https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x?product=Cisco&sort=-day_sir#~Vulnerabilities )Microsoft Technical Security Notifications ( https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dd252948 )Tenable Product Security Advisories ( http://www.tenable.com/security )SANS Internet Storm Center ( https://isc.sans.edu )The Security Engineers make changes to the system to correct the flaws by following the change management process as governed by the VITG Cloud Change Management Process and Procedures Guide, section 13.The VITG Cloud employs a process to test software and firmware updates related to flaw remediation for effectiveness and potential side effects before installation, as follows:System Administrators carefully evaluate patches, hot fixes and service packs released from vendors in relation to their impact on and relevance to the VITG Cloud IaaS environment.Before patches are implemented in production, patches are tested in the test environment by first deploying the patches and verifying the system continues to function.

Security EngineersThe Network Engineers employ malicious code protection mechanisms at information system entry and exit points to detect and eradicate malicious code, as follows:The VITG Cloud Border Guard employs Cisco Firepower to review incoming and outgoing traffic from the Internet. VITG Cloud Border Guard Firepower sends the output of its real-time scans to the VITG Cloud MMS SIEM where a Severity 1 alert is configured to alarm if the scan detects infected files. The alert generates a ticket in the ticketing system for Security Analysts investigation and if necessary IR action.All Microsoft and Red Hat servers include Symantec Endpoint Protection for host-based antivirus, browser protection, intruder prevention, download protection, and host based firewall countermeasures. Symantec endpoint protection conducts both real-time scanning of active files in use as well as a comprehensive system scan every 24 hours. The Symantec Endpoint Manager sends the alert of any identified malware in real-time or daily scans, to the VITG Cloud MMS SEIM where a Severity 1 alert is configured to alert. The alert generates a ticket in the ticketing system for Security Analysts investigation and if necessary IR action.In addition to Symantec, Windows hosts include the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) suite of products. EMET includes the Data Execution Prevention (DEP), Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), and Structured Exception handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP) modules employing Microsoft best practices for securing the operating system by how it interacts with applications.The VITG Cloud Border Guard IDS receives updates automatically to its signature library typically once per week, more frequently if CISCO release signatures more frequently for instances such as zero day attacks.VITG Cloud MMS host-based protection AV is configured to automatically download and update its definitions from update servers that are within the VITG Cloud IaaS. Those definitions are downloaded and installed weekly.Cisco Security Manager (CSM) downloads IDS signatures as they become available from the vendor. The Security Engineer manually tests these signatures for flaws, then manually uploads them to the Cloud Border Guard IDS. The ticket systems generates a periodic ticket initiate this weekly action. Updates can be applied more frequently if required by heightened threat levels.Malicious code protection mechanisms come in two forms: 1) Network based, and 2) Host based.Network BasedVITG Cloud Border Guard has an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) set to alert on malicious traffic as it basses the boundary. The IPS operates scans in real time and sends alerts the SIEM.Host BasedSymantec endpoint protection conducts both a comprehensive system scan every 24 hours as well as real-time scanning of active files in use during file download, file opening of file execution.What Happens if Malicious Code is Detected?The Symantec Endpoint Manager sends the alert of any identified malware in real-time or daily scans, to the VITG Cloud MMS SEIM where a Severity 1 alert is configured to alert. The alert generates a ticket in the ticketing system for Security Analysts investigation and if necessary IR action.Before taking any action from an alert, Security Analysts validate that the signature is not a false positive prior to any action that may impact the operational status of the system.The alert validation process is as follows:For VITG Cloud Border Guard IDS alerts:Review the source and destination to identify the types of systems involved and review the alert details to see if they describe the systems involved. If not, the alert is flagged as false positive and documented in the ticket and elevated to Security Operations Manager for approval. If the systems involved match the alert type, the OS version / patch level / application are validated to determine if the system is vulnerable. If all these are a negative, then the alert is flagged as a false positive.For VITG Cloud MMS host-based protection Anti-Virus:The files involved are cross-referenced with other maintenance activities on the system to identify if this is an expected alert.For VITG Cloud MMS host-based protection:There are many directories known to have high rates of change for legitimate reasons, and those are ignored in the scans. If an alert is generated, the file type and directory structure are identified and researched to validate if the alert is against a file path / file that typically has a low or no rate of change (such as OS binaries). The alerts are cross-referenced with patching activities and other maintenance activities against that information system component.Handling False PositivesAs described above, each alert is reviewed to determine whether it is legitimate or a false positive. If it is determined that the alert is a false positive:The alert is documented in Cherwell as a False PositiveThe ticket is raised to management attentionThe following actions are performed:Stop the Incident Response process because it is generating a False PositiveIdentify the rule that generated the False PositiveContact the vendor to change technology signature or rules so that changes can be made to vendor updates.Make changes to in-house exceptions in accordance with Change management procedures and approvals.Potential Impact to Availability of the SystemBecause the analysis of all alerts incorporates False Positive determination before responsive action is taken, there is no negative impact to system availability.   ##

If the systems involved match the alert type, the OS version / patch level / application are validated to determine if the system is vulnerable. If all these are a negative, then the alert is flagged as a false positive.For VITG Cloud MMS host-based protection Anti-Virus:The files involved are cross-referenced with other maintenance activities on the system to identify if this is an expected alert.For VITG Cloud MMS host-based protection:There are many directories known to have high rates of change for legitimate reasons, and those are ignored in the scans. If an alert is generated, the file type and directory structure are identified and researched to validate if the alert is against a file path / file that typically has a low or no rate of change (such as OS binaries). The alerts are cross-referenced with patching activities and other maintenance activities against that information system component.Handling False PositivesAs described above, each alert is reviewed to determine whether it is legitimate or a false positive. If it is determined that the alert is a false positive:The alert is documented in Cherwell as a False PositiveThe ticket is raised to management attentionThe following actions are performed:Stop the Incident Response process because it is generating a False PositiveIdentify the rule that generated the False PositiveContact the vendor to change technology signature or rules so that changes can be made to vendor updates.Make changes to in-house exceptions in accordance with Change management procedures and approvals.Potential Impact to Availability of the SystemBecause the analysis of all alerts incorporates False Positive determination before responsive action is taken, there is no negative impact to system availability.

See AU-2 part d for details on what system components send logging data and the type of logging data that is sent.The SIEM automatically and in real-time analyzes the log data that it receives and uses over 3,500 correlation rules to detect suspicious activities in the system. Correlation rules define a condition to match incoming events. Event correlation enables Security Analysts to: make informed decisions on how to respond to security threats; validate effectiveness of existing security controls; measure and report compliance; and detect policy violations.The SIEM helps VITG Cloud to achieve its security monitoring objectives as follows:Ensure the proper functioning of internal processes and controls in furtherance of regulatory and compliance requirementsThe SIEM’s correlation rules look for system errors and anomalies that could indicate control failures.Examine system records to confirm that the system is functioning in an optimal, resilient, and secure stateThe SIEM receives system records from all system components and provides alerting (per the correlation rules) in situations indicating denial of service attacks or other attacks that could compromise system security and resiliency.Identify irregularities or anomalies that are indicators of a system malfunction or compromiseCorrelation rules provide the capability of detecting situations that could indicate a system malfunction or compromise.The SIEM has been configured to implement the above listed monitoring objectives and send alerts to the the Security Analysts and to Cherwell to open an incident ticket to initiate investigation into the events.The SIEM enables the detection of unauthorized connections whether they are local, network, or remote connections through the use of correlation events created to look for brute force attacks, and other types of connections such as SSH and telnet.Security Analysts identify unauthorized use of the information system through the following techniques and methods:The VITG Cloud MMS platforms are configured to look at the incoming log and trap stream and perform correlation on words, phrases, event codes and raise notifications to the VITG Cloud Ticketing system where Security Analysts review the alert to determine if it is malicious.The VITG Cloud MMS SIEM monitors all devices in the environment and conducts automatic, real-time correlation of events that are sent to the SIEM solution from the various components. If someone attempts to enter or execute a command or go to a location not authorized the correlation rules feed into the correlation directives which trip an alarm.Security Engineers have deployed monitoring devices:Strategically within the information system to collect organization-determined essential informationSecurity Engineers have deployed the Cisco Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that protects all VITG Cloud systems. The IDS system monitors all internet traffic to/from the IaaS. The IDS sends event logs, including alerts, to the SIEM solution to be incorporated in the event correlation. See part a of this control for more details on event correlation rules.At ad hoc locations within the system to track specific types of transactions of interest to the organizationAll devices in the system are configured to either have an OSSEC agent to push log events to the SIEM solution or are configured to push syslog and other events to the SIEM solution. This essentially creates a whole-system monitoring configuration as follows:VITG Cloud maintains the Cisco Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that protects all VITG Cloud systems. The IDS system monitors all Internet communication to/from the IaaS and alerts Security Analysts to any events that might pose a threat.The VITG Cloud MMS host-based protection is installed on all VITG Cloud systems in the VITG Cloud to provide assurance that nothing is being changed without informing Security Analysts.VITG Cloud protects information obtained from intrusion-monitoring tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion as follows:Access to the SIEM solution and the logging data therein is restricted and is governed by the processes described in AC-2 parts d,e, and f and enforced by the process described in AC-3.The Security Engineers have configured the SIEM solution to automatically hash log records in the system as they are received. If a log record is modified, the modified record will not match the original hash and will be identified and flagged by the SIEM solution as invalid.All devices send logging data to the VITG Cloud SIEM solution. In the event that a user (authorized or unauthorized) successfully clears or deletes log data from a specific device (such as a server), the log data is not lost. The log data pushed out to the SIEM solution is preserved outside of the original device.Security Analysts heightens the level of information system monitoring activity whenever there is an indication of increased risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible sources of information, as follows:Security Analysts monitor the global and local security situation by subscribing to and monitoring various mailing lists (i.e., US-CERT) and websites (See SI-2 part a) to keep informed of the global threat and vulnerability status. In the event an alert is transmitted, Security Analysts determine if the threat or vulnerability has a potential of impacting VITG Cloud. If the alert indicates a possible impact to VITG Cloud, Security Analysts can engage in or initiate one or all of the following measures to heighten the level of information system monitoring activity:Conduct an ad-hoc meeting to discuss the implications of the threat/vulnerability data and what should be done to mitigate any potential risk;Reach out to tenants if necessary to share threat data and communicate any other details needed to heighten monitoring;Update the use cases (correlation events) in the VITG Cloud MMS SIEM AlienVault to increase its detection capability;Ensure that host-based detection capabilities (i.e., Symantec and Tripwire), are at the latest update available*;Ensure that signatures in the IDSs have been updated*;Review specific logging activity pertinent to the threat or vulnerability data;Add or modify firewall rules to address the level of increased threat. For example, if a threat indicator contains a specific IP address, the firewall rules can be modified to ensure that traffic from that address is blocked.*Note: Signatures are updated frequently; however, these steps are conducted to ensure the latest signatures have been applied and they are working properly (e.g., no errors or problems detected with the update(s)).The ISSO obtains legal opinion with regard to information system monitoring activities in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, or regulations.VITG Cloud has at its disposal the VITG Legal Department, which comprises several teams, including an Assistant General Counsel assigned to the HCSD organization.VITG legal and HR teams are consulted where monitoring may impact privacy laws and or confidentiality of data. Proactively, this consultation is most prominent in “Consent to Monitoring” language presented on login banners presented upon authentication as covered in control AC-8 System Use Notification, as well as general understanding and acknowledgment of user activity monitoring outlined in PL-4 Rules of Behavior (ROB).Customer ResponsibilityCustomers are responsible for obtaining legal opinion with regard to information system monitoring activities on their systems, regardless of who is conducting the monitoring.Security Engineers configure the SIEM to provide monitoring information to the ISSO and System Manager, as needed.   ##

                     VITG Cloud implements security directives provided by the FedRAMP ISSO in accordance with established time frames specific to each directive. The VITG Cloud ISSO opens a Cherwell ticket in order to gather the required information or begin implementation of directive change.For instance, if a directive came from the FedRAMP ISSO with the established timeframe of 24 hours response time, then the VITG Cloud ISSO or designee would open a Cherwell ticket with a ‘Priority 1 Impact - Production Critical’ priority. The ticket would include either a request for change or request for information. Ultimately, the VITG Cloud ISSO would respond within the timeframe to the FedRAMP ISSO with updates on actions taken and/or the degree of noncompliance, if applicable.The expected time to respond to the ‘Priority 1 Impact - Production Critical’ priority incident is as follows:   ##
