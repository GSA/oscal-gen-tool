# oscal-gen-tool
This application generates OSCAL XML/JSON SSP (Security Security Plan),  OSCAL XML/JSON SAP (Security Assessment Plan) and OSCAL XML/JSON SAR (Security Assessment Report). 

# Project Requirements
The application is coded in C# as an ASP.NET web application Visual Studio project and is meant to run in standalone mode ONLY.   This project utilizes the OpenXML (DocumentFormat.OpenXml) and the Microsoft Office Interop (Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word) namespaces to perform XML parsing and perform document rendering.
# System Software Requirements
Windows 10
Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition

# Disclaimer
This project will ONLY work with the Milestone release 3 of the OSCAL schema from the NIST website (https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Open-Security-Controls-Assessment-Language) and does not address gaps between the NIST schema and the FedRAMP template requirements.   It maps elements between the two that match and will ignore those that do not.  The mappings can be adjusted and edited in Microsoft Word for the template by using the  Mapping Content Controls with the XML Panel within Microsoft Word.
